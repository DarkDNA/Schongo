Schongo Modular Bot

= What is Schongo
	Schongo is a bot Written by:
		* Ross Delinger
		* Wil Hall
		* Selig Arkin
	it is designed to be modular, but not too much. The idea is that the core functionality (command parsing, for example) is built into the bot,
	to prevent a mess of plugins to provide core functionality. :)
