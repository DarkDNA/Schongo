Schongo Modular Bot

= What is Schongo?
	Schongo is a modular bot written in python. It is the next in the iteration of bots Selig has made.
It is the first by the name of "Schongo" internally though.

= Why "Schongo"
	It was generated by a random name generator a few years ago, and Selig liked it.

= What are your plans
	In the immediate future I plan to:
* Fix config in a modular way that will remain clean
* Implement some form of persistance for plugins (This is most visible in the "Dynamic" module)
* Make more modules.
