Schongo Modular Bot

= What is Schongo =
	Schongo is a bot Written by:
		* Ross Delinger (Posiden)
		* Wil Hall
		* Selig Arkin
	it is designed to be modular, but not too much. The idea is that the core functionality (command parsing, for example) is built into the bot,
	to prevent a mess of plugins to provide core functionality. :)

= What are the plans? =
	Check out the TODO File
	
= Setup =
	To setup Schongo: copy data/example.cfg to data/config.cfg
	Then edit config.cfg with the irc network details
	
	Then type this into terminal or cmdline:
		python schongo.py

= Developing =
	For notes on developing plugins for Schongo please cread the `DEV README' file
		
= The Basics =
	- Commands -
		-> Basic Commands:
			The default config sets '@' as the prefix for commands so all commands in tis README use it
			commands look like this:
				@command arg1 arg2 arg3
	
		-> Dynamic Commands:
			Dynamic commands are managed using the dynamic.py module
			
			Dynamic commands can use special syntax enhancements, such as %%Nick%% to refer to the person's nick, or %%Channel%% The syntax is as follows:
			%%Variable%% - Replaced with the value of Variable
			%[function name][function args]% - Dynamic function, such as random
			
			To Call a dynamic command use the same @command syntax as normal commands
			To add a command make sure the dynamic module is loaded then call @add <command> <command result>
	
	- Modules -

			use @load mod <list of modules> to load modules
